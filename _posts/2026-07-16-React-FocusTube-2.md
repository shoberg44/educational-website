## What You Will Learn in This Section

- How API endpoints, requests, and responses work in a client-only mobile application.
- How to structure an API helper layer in React Native for cleaner, more secure code.
- How to connect, fetch, parse, and display live YouTube data in your mobile UI using React hooks.

## Introduction to APIs

### What is an API?

An API is an **Application Programming Interface**. Think of it as a bridge that allows two different pieces of software to talk to each other. 

Today, we will be working with **REST APIs**, which are the standard way applications communicate over the internet. They use HTTP methods—the same methods your browser uses to fetch web pages. The two most common methods are:

- **GET**: When you want to retrieve data from a source (like reading a webpage).
- **POST**: When you want to send new data to a source (like submitting a login form).

### A Real-World Example

Imagine you want to build a *Pokémon Information App* on your phone. 

The hard way to build this app would be manually researching and typing out the stats for all 1,000+ Pokémon into your own app. **This is where an API saves the day**. There is a free service called `PokeAPI` that already has all this data. You just have to ask for it!

Here is how the interaction works:
1. **The Request:** Your mobile app sends an HTTP request to the API asking for specific data (e.g., "Give me the stats for Pikachu").
2. **The Processing:** The API server receives your request, finds Pikachu's data in its database, and formats it.
3. **The Response:** The server sends the data back to you in a format your code can read, usually **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation).

In code, making that request looks like this:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu');
const apiData = await response.json();
```

And the `apiData` you get back will look something like this:

```json
{
 "name": "pikachu",
 "height": 4,
 "weight": 60,
 "types": [
   { "type": { "name": "electric" } }
 ]
}
```

> **QUESTION:** Looking at the JSON data above, how is a JSON object similar to a standard JavaScript object? If you wanted to get the Pokemon's weight from `apiData`, what code would you write?

## Transitioning to the YouTube API

Just like PokeAPI provides us with Pokémon data, Google provides a **YouTube API** that lets developers access real YouTube videos, playlists, and channel data programmatically. 

Instead of showing Pikachu's stats, we will be requesting real video search results to power FocusTube!

### Enabling the YouTube API

Unlike PokeAPI, Google needs to know who is requesting their data to prevent abuse. To do this, we need to generate a unique "password" called an **API Key**.

Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to get started:

1. If you have not made a project before, [follow this quick tutorial](https://youtu.be/dTT1RGW8eYw?feature=shared&t=17) to get one set up.
2. Next, open the **Navigation hamburger menu** at the top left.
3. Select **APIs & Services** > **Library**.
4. In the search box, search for **"youtube data api v3"**. Click on the result, then click **Enable**.
5. You will be taken to the dashboard. In the middle-left of the screen, select the **Credentials** tab.
6. On the right side of the screen, click **+ Create Credentials** and select **API Key**.
7. Select Public data, we aren't accessing youtube's private user data.
8. Copy the generated **API Key** and save it somewhere safe for now. **DO NOT POST THIS ANYWHERE ON THE INTERNET.**

**Congratulations!** You now have an API key for the YouTube API.

### Securing Your API Key in React Native

Because your API key acts as a password to your Google account's API quota, you must hide it from the public.

In Web frameworks like NextJS, we can safely hide our API keys in a backend server that the client cannot see. However, React Native compiles into a mobile app that runs **entirely** on the user's phone. 

> **WARNING:** In production-ready mobile apps, client-side API keys can be extracted by hackers reverse-engineering your app's code. To secure it fully, you would build a separate backend server to act as a proxy. For this educational project, we will use Expo's built-in client-side environment variable system.
{: .prompt-warning }

Let's set up environment variables in Expo:

1. In the root directory of your project (the same folder that holds `package.json`), create a new file named `.env`.
2. Open the `.env` file and paste your API Key like this:

```console
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_KEY=yourapikeyhere
```

> **IMPORTANT:** In Expo, all environment variables must start with the prefix `EXPO_PUBLIC_` for the app to access them!
{: .prompt-danger }

3. Ensure you have a `.gitignore` file and that `.env` is listed inside it. This guarantees that your API key will never be uploaded to GitHub.

## Creating your API Service Layer

Since React Native does not run on a server, we do not build `/api/...` server routes like you would in NextJS. Instead, we make HTTP requests directly from our app.

However, writing direct `fetch()` calls inside our visual UI components is bad practice. It makes the code cluttered and hard to maintain. To keep our code clean, we will create a dedicated **API Service Layer** to abstract these details.

In your project root, create a new folder named `services/`. Inside it, create a file named `youtube.ts`.

We need three different functions in this service to handle our data:
- `fetchVideoDetails(videoId)`
- `searchVideos(query, type)`
- `fetchPlaylistVideos(playlistId)`

**This is what your tree structure should look like now**:

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── _layout.tsx
│   ├── index.tsx
│   ├── playlist/
│   │   └── [playlistId].tsx
│   ├── search/
│   │   └── [searchId].tsx
│   └── video/
│       └── [videoId].tsx
└── services/
    └── youtube.ts
```

### Writing the Service Logic

We will use the JavaScript `URL` helper class to dynamically build our query strings with query parameters (e.g. `?part=snippet&key=...`).

Here is the helper code for `services/youtube.ts`:

```typescript
const BASE_URL = "https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3";
const API_KEY = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_KEY;

export async function fetchVideoDetails(videoId: string) {
  const url = new URL(`${BASE_URL}/videos`);
  url.searchParams.set("part", "snippet,contentDetails,statistics");
  url.searchParams.set("id", videoId);
  url.searchParams.set("key", API_KEY || "");

  try {
    const response = await fetch(url.toString());
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Failed to fetch video details");
    }
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("fetchVideoDetails Error:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}

export async function searchVideos(query: string, type: string) {
  const url = new URL(`${BASE_URL}/search`);
  url.searchParams.set("part", "snippet");
  url.searchParams.set("q", query);
  url.searchParams.set("type", type);
  url.searchParams.set("key", API_KEY || "");
  
  if (type === "video") {
    url.searchParams.set("videoDuration", "medium");
  }

  try {
    const response = await fetch(url.toString());
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Failed to search videos");
    }
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("searchVideos Error:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}

export async function fetchPlaylistVideos(playlistId: string) {
  const url = new URL(`${BASE_URL}/playlistItems`);
  url.searchParams.set("part", "snippet");
  url.searchParams.set("playlistId", playlistId);
  url.searchParams.set("maxResults", "25");
  url.searchParams.set("key", API_KEY || "");

  try {
    const response = await fetch(url.toString());
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Failed to fetch playlist");
    }
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("fetchPlaylistVideos Error:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Calling the API and Displaying the Data

Now that we have our service layer, we can load this data directly into our React Native screens! 

Let's work on our `/search` screen first.

### Fetching Data inside `useEffect`

Because fetching data from the internet takes time, we run it asynchronously. In React, we use the `useEffect` hook to trigger our API call when the screen loads, and use `useState` to save the results so the screen re-renders once the data arrives.

Here is the implementation of `app/search/[searchId].tsx`:

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Image, ScrollView, ActivityIndicator } from 'react-native';
import { Link, useLocalSearchParams } from 'expo-router';
import { searchVideos } from '../../services/youtube';

export default function SearchPage() {
 const { searchId } = useLocalSearchParams();
 const [results, setResults] = useState<any>(null);
 const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

 useEffect(() => {
   const getResults = async () => {
     try {
       // encodeURIComponent ensures weird characters don't break our URL
       const data = await searchVideos(searchId as string, "video");
       setResults(data);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(error);
     } finally {
       setLoading(false);
     }
   };

   getResults();
 }, [searchId]);

 if (loading) {
   return (
     <View className="flex-1 bg-black justify-center items-center">
       <ActivityIndicator size="large" color="#ef4444" />
     </View>
   );
 }

 return (
   <ScrollView className="flex-1 bg-black p-4">
     <Text className="text-white text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Search Results</Text>
     
     <View className="pb-10">
       {results?.items?.map((vid: any) => (
         <Link href={`/video/${vid.id.videoId}`} asChild key={vid.id.videoId}>
           <View className="w-full bg-neutral-800 rounded-xl p-3 flex-row mb-4">
             <Image 
               source={{ uri: vid.snippet.thumbnails.medium?.url }}
               className="w-40 h-24 rounded-lg"
             />
             <View className="flex-1 ml-3 justify-start">
               <Text className="text-white text-base font-bold" numberOfLines={2}>
                 {vid.snippet.title}
               </Text>
               <Text className="text-gray-400 text-xs mt-1" numberOfLines={2}>
                 {vid.snippet.description}
               </Text>
             </View>
           </View>
         </Link>
       ))}
     </View>
   </ScrollView>
 );
}
```
{: file="app/search/[searchId].tsx" }
{: .nolineno }

> **QUESTION:** In the code above, we use the `numberOfLines` property on the `<Text>` components. Why is this important when rendering dynamic data from an external API on mobile devices?
{: .prompt-tip }

### Video Screen Integration

Now that clicking a video card links to `/video/[videoId]`, let's update `app/video/[videoId].tsx` to load the actual YouTube Player and display the video details!

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, ScrollView, ActivityIndicator } from 'react-native';
import { useLocalSearchParams } from 'expo-router';
import YoutubePlayer from 'react-native-youtube-iframe';
import { fetchVideoDetails } from '../../services/youtube';

export default function VideoScreen() {
  const { videoId } = useLocalSearchParams();
  const [video, setVideo] = useState<any>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const getDetails = async () => {
      try {
        const data = await fetchVideoDetails(videoId as string);
        setVideo(data.items?.[0] ?? null);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    getDetails();
  }, [videoId]);

  if (loading) {
    return (
      <View className="flex-1 bg-black justify-center items-center">
        <ActivityIndicator size="large" color="#ef4444" />
      </View>
    );
  }

  const title = video?.snippet?.title ?? "No Title";
  const description = video?.snippet?.description ?? "No Description";

  return (
    <ScrollView className="flex-1 bg-black">
      <View className="p-4">
        <YoutubePlayer
          height={220}
          play={false}
          videoId={videoId as string}
        />
        <Text className="text-white text-2xl font-bold mt-4">{title}</Text>
        
        <View className="bg-neutral-800 p-4 rounded-xl mt-4">
          <Text className="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">{description}</Text>
        </View>
      </View>
    </ScrollView>
  );
}
```
{: file="app/video/[videoId].tsx" }
{: .nolineno }

### Challenge Task: Build the Playlist Page

> **TASK: Complete the Playlist Screen**
> Give an attempt at making the playlist page inside `app/playlist/[playlistId].tsx`.
> - Import the `fetchPlaylistVideos` function from your API service.
> - Fetch the playlist items using the `playlistId` from the route parameters.
> - Display them in a list of video cards similar to your search screen.
> - Make sure each video card successfully links to the video screen!
{: .prompt-warning }

## Final Challenge Task (Pagination & Filtering)

Lastly, YouTube's search endpoint sometimes returns channels or YouTube Shorts, even when we specify we want standard videos. 

To improve the user experience:
- Look at the items returned by the search API. Each item has a `kind` under `id` (e.g. `vid.id.kind`).
- Filter your `.map()` or use a `.filter()` function to ensure we *only* display actual videos (`youtube#video`) and skip channels or playlists!

## Congrats!

You have finished the mobile migration of FocusTube!

There is a ton more you can do with this project. Here are some ideas:
- Utilize the button we did not program yet: Search Playlists.
- Make a dedicated Channel screen.
- Fetch and display comments below the video description.
- Connect OAuth authorization to display the student's *own* subscribed feeds and playlists directly!

Thank you for sticking to the end. I hope you enjoyed the ride and learned something new about mobile development with React Native and Expo!
