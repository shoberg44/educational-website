## About the project

Welcome to the Syllabus To CSV tutorial! In this project, you will learn the fundamentals of JS and learn how to create a project from start to finish.

**What you will learn:**

- How to setup and run a chrome extension.
- How to call REST APIs and process their responses.
- Create a basic UI with HTML and CSS.
- Interact with DOM elements with JS.

**What you will make:**

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a working chrome extension that takes a class syllabus and converts it into a CSV with all your class assignments.

**Further possibilities:**

Once you've completed this tutorial, you can expand on it in many ways! You could add different types of conversions, convert the current webpage to CSV or even an image. You can also use it to extract different information out of the syllabus, grade charts or instructor list. The possibilities are endless.

## Setup

We are going to create a new GitHub repo for this project, no starter code needed.

- Navigate to GitHub desktop
- Click on the repository dropdown
- Select `Add` > `Create new repository`
- Give it a Name and *optionally* a description
- Click create repository
- Open in your preferred IDE

Create a file called `manifest.json`, make sure to give it a name and description.

```json
{
    "name": "YOUR NAME HERE",
    "description": "YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE",
    "version": "1.0",
    "manifest_version": 3,
    "action": {
      "default_popup": "index.html",
    },
}
```
{: file="manifest.json" }

This is a setup file that tells your browser some basic info about your extension. You are telling it to use `index.html` as the popup, the name, description, and version of your extension along with the version of the manifest you want to use (the different manifest versions just change what parameters you have access too). There are a lot of different things you can add to the manifest.

- Images for your extension
- Background scripts
- Permissions
- Much more

Next lets create the base popup HTML. Create a file called `index.html`, give it a title (this can be the same as the manifest name).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>EXTENSION NAME</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My super cool extension</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
{: file="index.html" }

This is telling the browser what you want the popup to look like. In the `head` tag you are specifying the metadata.

- What character set to use.
- How big the popup should be (default width).
- What the title of the popup should be (this is more useful with websites but still important to set).

Next in the `body` tag we are defining the content of the extension. For now we are just adding some text.

### Set up your Browser

We will be using chrome as an example but it should be similar for most other browsers.

- Navigate to your extensions page [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/){:target="\_blank"}
- Make sure to toggle it into developer mode (top right corner)
- Select `Load unpacked` and select the root folder (outermost folder) of your GitHub repo
- You should see your extension in the extension list

## Running the project

You should see your extension in your extension list (you might need to pin it). All you need to do to "run" your extension is to click on its icon. For debugging you can right-click on the icon and select `Inspect popup` to open dev tools. Whenever you make a change make sure to go to the extensions page and click the reload icon at the bottom of your extensions card.

> Make sure you reload your extension after changing anything or you will not see the changes.
{: .prompt-danger }

## Create a basic UI

Let’s improve the popup so users can upload their syllabus file for us to use!

Within our `<body>` element, we’ll add an `<input>` element with the type set to `"file"` — this allows users to select and submit their syllabus and add a respective id which we will use for our event listeners. Just below the input, we’ll include a `<p>` tag to let users know where they’ll be able to click and download their CSV file, which can contain text like **Click here to download your file!**.

> **Tip:** Make sure to properly close both the `<input>` and `<p>` tags.
{: .prompt-info }
Next, we need to connect our JavaScript to this HTML. To do that, we’ll add a `<script>` tag right before the closing `</body>` tag. The script should have `type="module"` and `src="popup.js"`.

Using `type="module"` allows us to use modern JavaScript features such as `import` and `export` statements. The `src` attribute tells the browser to load the logic from our `popup.js` file — the place where all our “behind-the-scenes” functionality will live. Later, we’ll also update the `innerHTML` of the `<p>` tag to contain a downloadable link once the file has been processed.

> Make sure to include the script tag at the bottom of the body or else your JavaScript will not work on your HTML elements.
{: .prompt-warning }

Your `index.html` should finally look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Syllabus to CSV</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>MasterList</h1>
    <input type="file" id="file-upload" name="filename">
    <p>Click on the File to download it:<p>

    <script type="module" src="popup.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
## Handle file uploads

Now that we’ve set up a file input, let’s write the JavaScript needed to handle uploaded files and prepare them for processing. Create a file in the root directoy named `popup.js`.

We’ll be using `document.getElementById()` to grab our file input and attach an event listener that runs every time a user selects a file.

```js
document.getElementById('file-upload').addEventListener('change', async () => {
    // all the lines below will go inside here
});
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }
Here, we’re listening for the "change" event on the file input id (or whatever id you used) — this fires whenever a user picks a file.
```js
async () => {}
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }
Async allows us to use await inside the function. Since we'll likely send the file to an external API (which takes time), we want to pause and wait for the response before moving on — this keeps the code clean and readable.

Without async, we’d have to use .then() chains, which are harder to manage.

Arrow function syntax (() => {}) is a modern way to write functions in JavaScript. It's short, clean, and avoids creating its own this context — which works well here since we don’t need to refer to the event handler’s context directly.

> **Tip:** In short we use async () => {} to write cleaner, more modern code that lets us easily work with APIs that take time to respond.
{: .prompt-info }
```js
const fileUploaded = this.files.item(0);
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }
This line attempts to grab the first file the user selected.

> **BUG HUNT:** If you test this event handler by selecting a file and opening the DevTools Console (right-click the extension popup and click **Inspect**), you will see `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'item')`! Why is `this.files` undefined inside an arrow function `async () => {}`, and how can we use the `event` parameter instead?
{: .prompt-danger }

### Fixing the `this` Context

Unlike traditional `function()` declarations, arrow functions (`() => {}`) do not bind their own `this` context — `this` refers to the global window object. To access the uploaded file safely inside an arrow event listener, pass the `event` parameter and use `event.target.files[0]`:

```js
document.getElementById('file-upload').addEventListener('change', async (event) => {
    const fileUploaded = event.target.files[0];
    if (!fileUploaded) {
        return;
    }
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }

```js
const form = new FormData();
form.append('purpose', 'ocr');
form.append('file', new File([fileUploaded], `${fileUploaded.name}`));
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }

Here, we create a FormData object to prepare for sending the file to an external API.

FormData works like a key-value map that you can send with fetch() for things like file uploads.

We add two things:

A purpose field — this is useful if your API requires it (in this case, to label it for OCR processing).

The actual uploaded file, wrapped in a new File object.

> **Note:** Wrapping the file again with new File([...]) is optional but helpful if you want to manipulate the name or metadata before sending.
{: .prompt-info }

This is the foundation of getting the syllabus file from the user and preparing it for conversion.

At this point your code should look similar to this:
```js
document.getElementById('file-upload').addEventListener('change', async (event) => {
    const fileUploaded = event.target.files[0];
    if (!fileUploaded) {
        return;
    }
    const form = new FormData();
    form.append('purpose', 'ocr');
    form.append('file', new File([fileUploaded], `${fileUploaded.name}`));
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }

In the next step, we’ll send this FormData to an OCR model for parsing and response.

## Getting Your first API Key

Before we can send our syllabus to an AI model, we need an API key to authenticate with [Mistral OCR](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ocr), the model we’ll be using to process and extract text from PDF files.

### What is Mistral OCR?

Mistral OCR is a powerful AI model that can extract structured information from scanned documents, including PDFs — which is exactly what we need for turning a syllabus into a list of assignments.

> Learn more: [Mistral OCR announcement](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ocr)
{: .prompt-info }

### What is an API?

Before we use Mistral OCR, let’s take a quick step back and understand **what an API actually is**.

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a way for two programs to talk to each other. In our case, we’ll be using JavaScript to talk to an external AI service (Mistral) — and that conversation happens through an API.

> Think of it like placing an order at a restaurant: you (the client) tell the waiter (the API) what you want, and the waiter brings it from the kitchen (the server). You don’t need to know how the kitchen works — just how to place an order properly.
{: .prompt-info }

### Helpful Videos

  *This video explains APIs using real-world analogies — perfect if you're just starting out.*

- [**4 Most Important HTTP Requests That Can Be Made to an API**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkfVQK6UxDI)  
  *This breaks down the core HTTP methods you'll use when working with APIs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.*

### What is an API Key?

An API key is like a password that allows your project to communicate with a third-party service (in this case, Mistral). It tells the API who you are and whether you’re allowed to use it.

Think of it like a secret access badge — you’ll need one to send your file and get a response from Mistral.

### Step 1: Get your Mistral API Key

1. Go to [https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys)
2. Log in or create an account
3. If this is your first time, you’ll be prompted to choose an API plan — make sure to select the free one
4. Click **“Create API Key”**
5. Copy the key — it will look something like:  mistral-key-abc1234567890
   
> Important: If you skip selecting a plan, your API key won’t be usable yet. Be sure to select the free tier after signing up so you can continue with the tutorial.
{: .prompt-warning }   

### Step 2: Create a `hidden.js` file

To keep your API key separate from your main code (and avoid accidentally uploading it), let’s store it in a new file.

Create a file called: `hidden.js`

And inside it, write:

```js
const mistralApiKey = "your-mistral-api-key-here";
const geminiApiKey = "your-gemini-api-key-here"; // for using Gemini later

export default {
  mistralApiKey,
  geminiApiKey
};
```
{: file="hidden.js" }
{: .nolineno }

> Never commit this file to GitHub!
If you’re using Git, be sure to add `hidden.js` to your `.gitignore`.
{: .prompt-danger }

### What is a .gitignore file?
When you use Git to track your project’s files (like code, images, config files), you don’t always want everything to be tracked or pushed to GitHub. That’s where `.gitignore` comes in.

> A `.gitignore` file tells Git: Ignore these files. Don’t include them in version control or upload them to GitHub.

This is really helpful for:

- Sensitive files (like API keys in `hidden.js`)
- Build folders (dist/, node_modules/, etc.)
- System files (like .DS_Store on macOS or Thumbs.db on Windows)

### How it works
If a file or folder matches a rule in `.gitignore`, Git will pretend it doesn’t exist.
It won’t track changes to it, and it won’t push it to a remote repo like GitHub.  

### How to add something to .gitignore
Just open the `.gitignore` file in your project root (or create one if it doesn’t exist), and add the filename or folder you want to ignore.

For example:

```gitignore
# Ignore API key file
hidden.js

# Ignore all files in node_modules/
node_modules/
```
{: file=".gitignore" }
{: .nolineno }

Now Git will skip these files when committing or pushing your code — keeping things secure and clean.

> Best practice: Always add secret files like `hidden.js` to `.gitignore` before uploading your project to GitHub.
{: .prompt-tip }

### Step 3: Import your API keys
In your `popup.js`, import them like this:
```js
import apiKeys from "./hidden.js";
const mistralApiKey = apiKeys.mistralApiKey;
const geminiApiKey = apiKeys.geminiApiKey;
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }

You're now ready to securely connect to Mistral and begin sending files for parsing! Next up: we’ll write the code that sends our FormData to the Mistral OCR API!

## Convert upload to PDF

Now that we’ve built our `FormData` object containing the uploaded syllabus file, we’re ready to send it to **Mistral’s OCR API** for processing.

We’ll do this using JavaScript’s `fetch()` function — this allows us to make requests to APIs directly from the browser.

Here’s the full function:

```js
/**
 * Convert a PDF to a JSON object
 * 
 * @param {FormData} form 
 * @returns {Promise<Object>}
 */
async function PDFToJson(form) {
    const uploadedPDF = await fetch('https://api.mistral.ai/v1/files', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            "Authorization": `Bearer ${mistralApiKey}`
        },
        body: form,
    });

    const PDFJson = await uploadedPDF.json(); 

}
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }
Let’s break it down step-by-step:
### The comment block at the top
```js
/**
 * Convert a PDF to a JSON object
 * 
 * @param {FormData} form 
 * @returns {Promise<Object>}
 */
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }
This is a JSDoc-style comment, which is a great practice even in beginner projects. It tells other developers (or future you):

- What this function does
- What kind of argument it expects (FormData)
- What it returns (a promise that resolves to a JSON object)

> Writing clear comments like this helps others understand your code quickly and makes your project easier to maintain or expand in the future.
{: .prompt-info }

###  Fetch
```js
fetch('https://api.mistral.ai/v1/files', { ... })
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }
This is the URL of Mistral’s file upload API. When we call this, we’re telling Mistral:

> “Hey, I want to upload a file for OCR processing.”
{: .prompt-info }

```js
method: 'POST'
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }
This tells the API we want to send data (in this case, the file).
There are other methods like GET, PUT, and DELETE, but POST is most common for sending form or file data.

### Headers
```js
headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer ... " }
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }
APIs often require authentication — this is how they know who you are.

The "Authorization" header tells the API,

"Here’s my API key — please allow me to use your service."

"Bearer" is the standard keyword used to pass tokens securely.

You should already have your API key stored in `hidden.js`, and here we’re inserting it using backticks and ${} for string interpolation.

### Body
```js
body:form
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }
This is the actual file upload!
We’re sending the FormData object we created earlier (which includes the PDF file) as the body of the request.
```js
await uploadedPDF.json()
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }

Once Mistral finishes processing the file, it sends back a response — usually in JSON format.

> If you **don’t** call `.json()` and just look at the `response` object itself, you’ll get a **network response object**, not the actual data.
{: .prompt-danger }

We call .json() on the response to convert it into an object we can work with in JavaScript.

### What does Mistral send back?
It doesn’t send back the converted syllabus — not yet.

Instead, it responds with file metadata, like this:

```json
{
  "id": "file-abc123",
  "status": "uploaded",
  "filename": "syllabus.pdf",
  "created_at": "2024-03-23T15:12:00Z"
}
```
{: .nolineno }
This response tells us:

The upload was successful!

We now have a file ID that we can use to request a signed download URL in the next step

The OCR processing hasn’t happened yet — we’ll request it next!

> Important: This function does not do OCR yet. It only uploads the file and gives back an ID.
We'll use this ID in a follow-up request to get the downloadable link and send that to Mistral's OCR model.
{: .prompt-info }

### Upload PDF to get URL

Now that we’ve uploaded the file, Mistral gave us a **file ID** in the response. We’re going to use that ID to request a **signed file URL** — a secure, temporary link to download or reference the uploaded file.

### Make the API Call

Use the `fetch()` function to make a **GET request** to this endpoint: https://api.mistral.ai/v1/files/FILE_ID/url?expiry=24

> Replace `FILE_ID` with the ID you received from the previous step (`PDFJson.id`)
{: .prompt-info }

This tells Mistral:  

> “Please give me a temporary link to access the file I just uploaded.”
{: .prompt-info }

The `expiry=24` part means the link will only work for **24 hours**.

### Headers You’ll Need

Your request should include a `headers` object with the following:

```js
headers: {
  "Accept": "application/json",
  "Authorization": `Bearer ${mistralApiKey}`
}
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }
> **QUESTION:** What does the header `"Accept": "application/json"` communicate to the API server? What might happen if a client doesn't specify which content format it expects back?
{: .prompt-tip }

> **TASK 1:** Use `fetch()` to make a `GET` request to `https://api.mistral.ai/v1/files/FILE_ID/url?expiry=24` (replacing `FILE_ID` with `PDFJson.id`), pass the required `headers`, and extract the signed download URL using `.json()`.
{: .prompt-warning }

Once you’ve done that, you’ll have access to a temporary URL like:
```json
{
  "url": "https://cdn.mistral.ai/files/abc123/syllabus.pdf?token=..."
}
```
{: .nolineno }
We’ll use that URL in the next step when we send the file to Mistral’s OCR model for analysis!

> Hint: Store the result in a variable like responseJSON, then access the URL with responseJSON.url
{: .prompt-info }

## Parse PDF to Markdown

Now that you’ve obtained a **temporary URL** to the uploaded file, it’s time to send that file to Mistral’s OCR model and get back structured text.

### Your Turn: Make the OCR API Call

You’re going to use `fetch()` again — this time to **POST** the signed URL to Mistral’s OCR endpoint.

**API Endpoint:** https://api.mistral.ai/v1/ocr

In your request, you’ll need these headers:

```js
headers: {
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "Authorization": `Bearer ${mistralApiKey}`
}
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }
The Body (What You’re Sending)
Before we send the body, we need to convert our JavaScript object into a string using JSON.stringify().

> **QUESTION:** Why do web APIs expect serialized JSON strings (via `JSON.stringify()`) in HTTP request bodies instead of raw in-memory JavaScript objects?
{: .prompt-tip }

> **TASK 2:** Use `fetch()` with method `'POST'` to send the JSON-stringified document payload to `https://api.mistral.ai/v1/ocr`, pass the authentication headers, and extract the result using `.json()`.
{: .prompt-warning }

## Parse upload into assignment list

Now that you’ve received the OCR response from Mistral, it's time to prepare the text for assignment extraction.

The OCR response (`ocrJson`) contains a list of pages — and each page includes a `markdown` field with the text that Mistral pulled from that page.

We want to loop through all those pages and combine the Markdown into one big string we can send to an AI model later.

> **TASK 3:** Loop through `ocrJson.pages` and concatenate the `markdown` property from each page into a single combined Markdown string.
{: .prompt-warning }

> **NOTE:** By combining all page content into one Markdown string, we can pass it to an AI model in a single prompt and ask it to extract assignments for us — much easier than handling one page at a time!
{: .prompt-info }

Next, we’ll send that full Markdown string to an AI to find and extract a list of assignments.
## Sending upload to gemini

Now that you've combined all of your syllabus content into a single Markdown string, you're ready to send it to an AI model — in this case, **Google Gemini** — to extract your assignments and return them in a clean CSV format.

### Step 1: Get Your Gemini API Key

To use Gemini, you'll need to create an API key from Google’s developer console.

1. Go to [https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Copy the key and store it safely — we’ll use this in our fetch request

Just like we did with Mistral, you should store this key in your `hidden.js` file:

```js
const geminiApiKey = "your-gemini-api-key-here";
```
{: file="hidden.js" }
{: .nolineno }
> **TASK 4:** Implement `async function JsonToCSV(markdownExport)` to `POST` the combined markdown to Gemini's `generateContent` endpoint and request assignment extraction in CSV format.
{: .prompt-warning }

> **NOTE:** The more specific and clear your prompt is, the better your results will be. Instruct Gemini on exact column headers (`Due Date, Class, Assignment Name, Assignment Type, Checkbox`) and to return pure CSV data without markdown ticks.
{: .prompt-info }

## Downloading the file
Now that Gemini has returned your assignment list in CSV format, the final step is to let the user download it!

We’ll do this by programmatically creating a downloadable file in the browser using JavaScript.

Here’s the function you’ll use:
```
function createFileAndDownload(filename, content) {
    const blob = new Blob([content], { type: 'text/plain' });
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    const link = document.createElement('a');
    link.href = url;
    link.download = filename;
    document.body.appendChild(link);
    const p = document.createElement('p');
    p.innerHTML = filename;
    link.append(p);
}
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }

### How does this work?
- new Blob([content]): This creates a binary object (Blob) from your text. Think of it like a fake file we can give to the browser.

- URL.createObjectURL(blob): Generates a temporary download link from the Blob.

- document.createElement('a'): We create an anchor (<a>) tag and set its href to our blob URL.

- link.download = filename: This tells the browser what to name the downloaded file.

- Finally, we append the link (with a label) so the user can click and download it.

You can now call this function like so:

```js
createFileAndDownload("assignments.csv", geminiResponse);
```
{: file="popup.js" }
{: .nolineno }

If your response string includes some extra characters (like Markdown code block markers), make sure to clean it up first:
```js
const cleaned = geminiResponse.slice(6).slice(0, -3);
createFileAndDownload("assignments.csv", cleaned);
```
### Finishing our Event Listener
By the end of this tutorial, your full addEventListener function should look something like this:
```js
document.getElementById('file-upload').addEventListener('change', async (event) => {
    // Get fileUploaded, returns file object at index 0
    const fileUploaded = event.target.files[0];
    if (fileUploaded == null) {
        return;
    }

    // Create form object for PDF send to OCR API
    const form = new FormData();
    form.append('purpose', 'ocr');
    form.append('file', new File([fileUploaded], `${fileUploaded.name}`));

    // Send to Mistral and get structured markdown
    let ocrJson = await PDFToJson(form);

    // Combine all markdown content into one string
    let markdownExport = "";
    for (const element of ocrJson.pages) {
        markdownExport += element.markdown + " ";
    }

    // Send combined markdown to Gemini for CSV generation
    const geminiJson = await JsonToCSV(markdownExport);
    const geminiResponse = geminiJson.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text;

    // Download the result as a .csv file
    createFileAndDownload("downloadable.csv", geminiResponse.slice(6).slice(0, -3));
});
```
{: file="popup.js" } 
{: .nolineno }
> That’s it! You’ve now built a full Chrome extension that lets users upload a syllabus, extracts all assignments using AI, and downloads the results as a clean CSV file. 
{: .prompt-success }

## Extending your extension

Congratulations on finishing the core project! Here are some exciting directions you can take it next:
