## About the project

Welcome to the React Native FocusTube tutorial! Through this project, you will learn the fundamentals of building mobile apps, making your own API, calling APIs, and using Expo Router.

**What you will learn in this Series:**

- How to build a mobile app using React Native and Expo.
- How to use and create the fundamental parts of an API (endpoints, requests and responses) inside your Expo app.
- How to connect, fetch, parse, and display API data from YouTube.
- The fundamentals of Expo Router (File-Based Routing, Dynamic Routing, Layouts).
- How to style mobile apps using NativeWind (Tailwind for React Native).

**What you will make:**

By the end of this series, you will have a basic full-stack YouTube wrapper mobile app that allows you to use YouTube through your own design, such as removing YouTube’s distracting features.

## Disclaimer

**This series assumes a couple of things:**

- You have decent knowledge of JavaScript
- You have basic knowledge of React
- You already have the necessary tools installed (Node.js, an IDE like VS Code)

## React vs React Native Patterns

Before we begin coding, it is important to understand the difference between React (for the web) and React Native (for mobile). 

- **No HTML or DOM:** React Native compiles down to actual iOS and Android UI elements, not a web browser. This means you **cannot** use HTML tags like `<div>`, `<h1>`, or `<p>`. 
- **Component Translation:** Instead of HTML, React Native provides its own primitive components that you must import. You will swap web tags for Native tags like this:
  - `<div>` -> `<View>`
  - `<h1>`, `<p>` -> `<Text>`
  - `<input>` -> `<TextInput>`
  - `<button>` -> `<Pressable>` or `<TouchableOpacity>`

## Setup the project

You will be making your own project instead of forking a repository. Making a React Native app with Expo is incredibly easy!

Open a terminal. In the terminal, go to the folder you want your project to be in, then run this command:

```console
npx create-expo-app@latest
```

You will be prompted to name your project. I named mine **my-app**.

Next, you will be prompted to select an Expo SDK version (here's what mine looks like):

```console
Select an Expo SDK version: » - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
>   Latest (SDK 57) - Recommended for most projects
    For learning with Expo Go (SDK 54)
    Other SDK version…
```

> **IMPORTANT:** Because we are using the Expo Go app on our phones for this tutorial to make testing easy, you MUST select **For learning with Expo Go (SDK 54)**.
{: .prompt-danger }

The setup automatically configures **Expo Router**, which gives us Next.js style file-based routing out of the box!

<span style="text-decoration: underline;" title="type 'cd <file path>' into your terminal to change your working directory">cd</span> into that folder:

```console
cd my-app
```

### Installing NativeWind

Since we want to use standard TailwindCSS classes (like `className="flex flex-col"`) instead of writing complex `StyleSheet` objects, we will install **NativeWind**.

Run this command in your project folder to install NativeWind and its dependencies:

```console
$ npm install nativewind@4.2.3 tailwindcss@3.4.19 react-native-css-interop@0.2.3
$ npx expo install react-native-reanimated babel-preset-expo
```

Initialize Tailwind:

```console
npx tailwindcss init
```

This creates a `tailwind.config.js` file. Open it and update the `content` array to include your app's files, and add the nativewind preset:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ["./app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}", "./components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  presets: [require("nativewind/preset")],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Next, NativeWind requires a global CSS file. Create a file named `global.css` in your project root and add this inside:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Now, create a `metro.config.js` file in your root folder and add this code:
```javascript
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");
const { withNativeWind } = require("nativewind/metro");

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);
module.exports = withNativeWind(config, { input: "./global.css" });
```

Finally, newer versions of Expo don't always create a Babel config by default. Create a new file named `babel.config.js` in the root of your project folder (if it doesn't already exist) and update it to this:

```javascript
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: [
      ["babel-preset-expo", { jsxImportSource: "nativewind" }],
      "nativewind/babel"
    ]
  };
};
```

To make sure your app loads this styling globally, go into `app/_layout.tsx` and add this import to the very top of the file:
```javascript
import "../global.css";
```

### Start the App

Now, run this command to start your development server:

```console
npm run start
```

This will give you a QR code. You can download the **Expo Go** app on your phone to scan it and view your app live on your physical device, or press `i` to open it in an iOS Simulator if you have a Mac!

> **NOTE:** When you change your code and save, the Expo Go app will automatically refresh the screen for you. 
{: .prompt-info }

Now you are ready to start the tutorial! Take a look at your file tree. It should look something like this:

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── _layout.tsx
│   ├── index.tsx
│   └── +not-found.tsx
├── assets/
├── components/
├── constants/
├── scripts/
├── .gitignore
├── app.json
├── babel.config.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── tailwind.config.js
└── README.md
```

Feel free to check out **app/index.tsx** in your app folder, this is the **home screen** in your Expo app, which is a good transition into the first topic.

> **QUESTION:** There are some new files in our project. What are `package.json` and `app.json` used for in an Expo project?
{: .prompt-tip }

## File-Based Routing

**File-Based Routing** means that the structure of your files and folders inside the **app/** directory *automatically* defines the screens in your mobile app.

Let’s take a look at what this really means.

In your **/app** folder create a folder called *```video```*. In this folder create a file called **index.tsx**. In this file, put something really simple like this:

```tsx
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function Video() {
   return (
     <View className="flex-1 items-center justify-center bg-black">
       <Text className="text-white text-2xl">This is the Video page!</Text>
     </View>
   );
}
```
{: file="app/video/index.tsx" }
{: .nolineno }

Next, how do we see it? In Expo Router, you can navigate by altering the URL or pushing a route. If you are using Expo Go on your phone, you don't have a URL bar. But don't worry, we will add navigation buttons shortly!

> **QUESTION:** What is a component? They are key to truly mastering the power of React, so learn a high-level definition to keep in the back of your mind since this term will come up again and again.
{: .prompt-tip }

## Adding more Routes

Now that we know what file-based routing is, make **2 more routes**.

- ```/search```
- ```/playlist```

For now, these can display whatever you like.

Here is what your file tree should look like now:

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── _layout.tsx
│   ├── index.tsx
│   ├── playlist/
│   │   └── index.tsx
│   ├── search/
│   │   └── index.tsx
│   └── video/
│       └── index.tsx
```

You should have **4 routes** in your app: the home screen (`index.tsx`), ```/search```, ```/playlist```, and ```/video```.

Now that we have a couple routes, we can start to change how they look. Feel free to use the instructions as a guide to your own design, or copy it if you already feel comfortable in React and JS.

### The Power of NPM Packages (Video Route)

It is pretty easy to add YouTube videos into your app. If we were building a website, we would just use an HTML `<iframe>`. However, React Native compiles to actual mobile code, which doesn't support HTML tags!

Instead of writing complex Native iOS and Android code from scratch to display a video, we can use an **NPM Package**. Packages are pre-written blocks of code created by the community that we can download and use in our app instantly.

Run this command to install a popular YouTube video package:

```console
$ npm install react-native-youtube-iframe react-native-webview
```

> **QUESTION:** What are the benefits of using third-party packages instead of writing everything from scratch? Are there any potential downsides?
{: .prompt-tip }

Now, we can import this package and use it in our `/video` route:

```tsx
import { View } from 'react-native';
import YoutubePlayer from "react-native-youtube-iframe";

export default function Content() {
 return (
   <View className="flex-1 bg-black justify-center">
     <YoutubePlayer
       height={300}
       play={false}
       videoId={"your-youtube-video-id-here"}
     />
   </View>
 );
}
```
{: file="app/video/index.tsx" }
{: .nolineno }

> **BUG:** In the above answer I purposely **mistyped** one of the properties of `YoutubePlayer`. See if you can spot it or check your terminal logs!
{: .prompt-danger }

### Search Route

Next up, we have our `/search` route.

> **NOTE:** This may sound counter-intuitive, but the search page will display the search results, not the actual search bar. The search bar will be added on the *home page*, which we will get to shortly.
{: .prompt-info }

First, let's create a basic page component that just returns a title.

```tsx
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function SearchPage() {
 return (
   <View className="flex-1 bg-black items-center pt-10">
     <Text className="text-white text-3xl font-bold">Search Results</Text>
     {/* Video cards will go here */}
   </View>
 );
}
```
{: file="app/search/index.tsx" }
{: .nolineno }

> **QUESTION:** This is the second component we have seen. You may start to pick up a pattern on how they are constructed. What do these component functions return?
{: .prompt-tip }

Next, we need a way to mock a single "Video Card". A video card should have a thumbnail image, a title, and a description. We also want the entire card to be clickable so it can take the user to the `/video` route we just made! A perfect job for the Expo `<Link>` component.

Let's import `<Link>` from `expo-router` and `<Image>` from `react-native`, then add a dummy video card:

```tsx
import { View, Text, Image } from 'react-native';
import { Link } from 'expo-router';

export default function SearchPage() {
 return (
   <View className="flex-1 bg-black items-center pt-10 px-4">
     <Text className="text-white text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Search Results</Text>
     
     <Link href="/video" asChild>
       <View className="w-full bg-neutral-800 rounded-xl p-3 flex-row mb-4">
         <Image 
           source={{ uri: "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/abc123/mqdefault.jpg" }}
           className="w-40 h-24 rounded-lg"
         />
         <View className="flex-1 ml-3 justify-start">
           <Text className="text-white text-lg font-bold">How to Learn JavaScript</Text>
           <Text className="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-1">A quick guide to getting started with JavaScript.</Text>
         </View>
       </View>
     </Link>

   </View>
 );
}
```
{: file="app/search/index.tsx" }
{: .nolineno }

Wait, what is a `<Link>` component? Using this prebuilt component gives us a really cool ability...

> **QUESTION:**  Why do we import the `<Link>` component instead of just using a standard mobile button? 
{: .prompt-tip }

You can copy and paste the `<Link>` block multiple times if you want to see what a list of results looks like. Later in the tutorial, we will replace this hardcoded fake data with real API calls!

### Playlist Route

> **TASK:**  Make the playlist route. It is very similar to the search route. You got this!
{: .prompt-tip }

- Inside ```app/playlist/index.tsx```, create a React Native component that shows fake video cards in a playlist.
- Style each video as you want using NativeWind classes.
- Make sure each one links to the ```/video``` route!

## Main and Layout Pages

### Main Page

Our main page will also be relatively simple. There are just a couple things to implement, all of which you should be able to do on your own. Working code will be included below, but make sure to attempt it yourself first.

**What the main page should look like:**
- A search input, in which you can type anything
   - Searching should not be possible when the input is blank
- 4 different buttons, each leading to 4 different types of searches
   - **Regular Search Button:** A regular video search
   - **Playlist Search Button:** A search for playlists specifically
   - **Video ID Button:** Instead of a search, if you know the video ID, type it here and it will go straight to the video
   - **Playlist ID Button:** Like the video ID button, this will take you directly to the playlist instead of searching for it

### Understanding React State (`useState`)

Before we build the search bar, we need a way to keep track of what the user is typing into it. In React Native, regular variables don't work for this because updating them doesn't tell the screen to re-render and show the new text. 

Instead, we use a React Hook called `useState`. It allows us to create a special variable (our state) and a function to update it. When we use the update function, React knows the state has changed and automatically updates our screen to reflect the new data!

Here is how we use it to track a text input in React Native:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { TextInput } from 'react-native';

export default function MyComponent() {
  // We initialize our state variable 'text' to an empty string. 
  // 'setText' is the function we will call to update it.
  const [text, setText] = useState("");

  return (
    <TextInput 
      value={text} 
      onChangeText={(newText) => setText(newText)} 
    />
  );
}
```

> **QUESTION:** In React Native, we use `onChangeText` which provides the string directly. How does this differ from the web's `onChange` event?
{: .prompt-tip }

### Handling Button Clicks and Navigation

To make our navigation buttons work, we will also need the `onPress` event handler (the React Native equivalent of `onClick`). Let's see how that combines with navigation!

### Using Expo Router for Navigation

While `<Link>` is great for simple buttons and images, sometimes you need to navigate to a page after some logic runs—like when a user submits a search! 

For programmatic navigation, Expo Router provides the `useRouter` hook. 

```tsx
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';
import { Pressable, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleAction = () => {
    // Sends you to another route in your app
    router.push('/specified/path');

    // Or go back in your navigation history
    // router.back();
  };
  
  return (
    <Pressable onPress={handleAction}>
       <Text>Go!</Text>
    </Pressable>
  )
}
```

**Click below to unblur the different parts of the answer**

**Part 1: State and Navigation Setup**
First, we need to set up our React state to keep track of what the user types into the search bar. We also initialize `useRouter()` so we can send the user to different pages when they click the buttons.
```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { View, Text, TextInput, Pressable } from 'react-native';
import { useRouter } from "expo-router";

export default function Home() {
 const [input, changeInput] = useState("");
 const router = useRouter();

 const handleSubmit = () => {
   if (input.trim() !== "") {
     router.push(`/search/${input}`);
   }
 };
 
 // ... return statement below ...
```
{: file="app/index.tsx (Part 1)" }
{: .nolineno }
{: .blur }

**Part 2: The Search Input**
Next, we build the search input. We tie the `<TextInput>` value to our state, and when the user submits their keyboard (triggering `onSubmitEditing`), we use `router.push()` to navigate to the search results!

Please don't skip through without giving it a solid attempt :)

```tsx
 // ... inside Home() return statement ...
 return (
   <View className="flex-1 bg-black items-center pt-20 px-4">
     <View className="mb-10 items-center">
       <Text className="text-white text-5xl font-bold">Focus</Text>
       <Text className="text-red-600 text-5xl font-bold">Tube</Text>
     </View>

     <View className="w-full flex-row items-center mb-6">
         <TextInput
           className="flex-1 bg-neutral-800 text-white p-4 rounded-l-lg text-lg"
           value={input}
           onChangeText={changeInput}
           placeholder="Search for something..."
           placeholderTextColor="#888"
           onSubmitEditing={handleSubmit}
         />
         <Pressable 
           className="bg-red-600 p-4 rounded-r-lg" 
           onPress={handleSubmit}
         >
           <Text className="text-white font-bold text-lg">Search</Text>
         </Pressable>
     </View>
     {/* ... navigation buttons below ... */}
```
{: file="app/index.tsx (Part 2)" }
{: .nolineno }
{: .blur }

**Part 3: The Navigation Buttons**
Finally, we add our quick-navigation buttons. Since these don't require submitting the keyboard, we can just use simple `onPress` events to check if the input is empty, and if not, route the user to the correct page.
```tsx
     {/* ... inside Home() return statement ... */}
     <View className="w-full flex-row flex-wrap justify-between">
       <Pressable
         className="bg-neutral-800 p-3 rounded-lg w-[48%] mb-4 items-center"
         onPress={() => {
           if (input.trim() !== "") router.push(`/playlist-search/${input}`);
         }}
       >
         <Text className="text-white font-semibold">Search Playlists</Text>
       </Pressable>

       <Pressable
         className="bg-neutral-800 p-3 rounded-lg w-[48%] mb-4 items-center"
         onPress={() => {
           if (input.trim() !== "") router.push(`/playlist/${input}`);
         }}
       >
         <Text className="text-white font-semibold">Search Playlist ID</Text>
       </Pressable>

       <Pressable
         className="bg-neutral-800 p-3 rounded-lg w-full items-center"
         onPress={() => {
           if (input.trim() !== "") router.push(`/video/${input}`);
         }}
       >
         <Text className="text-white font-semibold">Search Video ID</Text>
       </Pressable>
     </View>
   </View>
 );
}
```
{: file="app/index.tsx (Part 3)" }
{: .nolineno }
{: .blur }

### Layout Page (`_layout.tsx`)

This page is unique in Expo Router, but is also very powerful.

**The layout page is the UI that is shared between routes.**

In Expo Router, this file is called `_layout.tsx`. No matter where you are in the app, **what is in the layout page wraps your current screen**.

This often includes:

- Any global providers you want to add
- Headers and/or footers
- A Bottom Tab Navigation bar or Drawer Navigation

Feel free to make your Layout page your own. Luckily, Expo already has a really useful one made for you that you can tweak!

## TailwindCSS via NativeWind

This portion is optional because I want this tutorial to focus more on APIs and React Native. However, if you are interested in learning more about TailwindCSS, you can try it out on this project! TailwindCSS has shown to be a very powerful library especially when it comes to AI.

Because we installed **NativeWind** during setup, you can use regular Tailwind classes on your Native components.

TailwindCSS is a different way of doing CSS. There are no ```StyleSheet``` objects; instead, you add classes for each style you want.

For example, in regular React Native, you may make a ```StyleSheet``` and add it like this:

```tsx
import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
   centerView: {
     flex: 1,
     justifyContent: 'center',
     alignItems: 'center'
   }
});

export default function MyComponent() {
  return <View style={styles.centerView}> <Text>Hello World</Text> </View>
}
```

In TailwindCSS, each one of these attributes is its own class that we can add straight to the component. For example:

```tsx
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function MyComponent() {
  return <View className="flex-1 justify-center items-center"> <Text>Hello!</Text> </View>
}
```

For a deeper dive, I highly suggest Fireship's 100-second video on TailwindCSS.

{% include embed/youtube.html id='mr15Xzb1Ook' %}

## Dynamic Routing

For many mobile apps, it is impossible to hardcode every single screen. This is one such case, as it needs to be able to render **any video on YouTube**.

Luckily, Expo Router has a pretty simple way to make the screen differ based on the parameters passed in the route. It's called **Dynamic Routing**.

**Here is an example:**

I have this route in my app:

`app/video/index.tsx`

Currently, this is kind of useless because there is only one video. However, with dynamic routing, we can insert the Video ID into the route to affect the screen.

In order to implement this, you will need to rename your route file to use brackets. It should look like this:

`app/video/[videoId].tsx`

Expo Router knows you have a dynamic route when the file or folder name has brackets around them.

**Pay attention to what you name the file inside the brackets. That is what we will need to call in the next section.**

### Where we need Dynamic Routing

We need dynamic routing pretty much anywhere the screen is impacted by parameters, which happens to be **all of our routes** in this case.

So, you should:
- Rename your route files to use brackets *(/search, /video, /playlist)*
- Name your files whatever you want, they just have to be in brackets to work: `[name].tsx`

Your file tree should now look like this:

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── _layout.tsx
│   ├── index.tsx
│   ├── playlist/
│   │   └── [playlistId].tsx
│   ├── search/
│   │   └── [searchId].tsx
│   └── video/
│       └── [videoId].tsx
```

#### Now navigate to each route by pushing `/route/[anything you want here]` (e.g. `/video/dQw4w9WgXcQ`)

Also, notice **if you try to navigate to just `/video`, it won't load the content page anymore.** This is because `index.tsx` was renamed into the dynamic route `[videoId].tsx`, **so a static `/video` route can no longer be found.**

## Using Params

The biggest reason why we use these dynamic routes is it makes it easy to pass information to the screen via the route URL.

In order to do so, we use the `useLocalSearchParams` hook from Expo Router.

- `useLocalSearchParams` is a React Hook that returns an object containing the dynamic route parameters.

```tsx
import { useLocalSearchParams } from 'expo-router';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function Route() {
   // Destructure the parameter name you chose for your file.
   // If your file is [videoId].tsx, you destructure 'videoId'.
   const { videoId } = useLocalSearchParams();

   return (
     <View className="flex-1 bg-black justify-center items-center">
       <Text className="text-white"> This is a Route containing Video ID: {videoId} </Text>
     </View>
   );
}
```
{: file="app/video/[videoId].tsx" }
{: .nolineno }

### Implementing Dynamic Route Parameters

Since all of our routes are dynamic, in every route, **call `useLocalSearchParams()` and integrate it in some way to your component**, even if it's just displaying the search term or playlist ID on screen.

### Challenge Task

**Make the parameter in `app/video/[videoId].tsx` determine the video ID that plays in your YouTube Player!**

> **HINT:** Look at how the `<YoutubePlayer>` component takes its `videoId` property.
{: .prompt-tip }

## React vs. React Native: Routing & Renders

If you have built websites using React or NextJS, you might be wondering about some of the differences:

- **No SSR (Server Side Rendering):** In NextJS, components run on the server by default. React Native runs **entirely on the client device**. There is no server rendering, which means we do not need to write `'use client'` at the top of our files!
- **Unified Hooks:** Since everything is on the client, you can use React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` anywhere in your application without restrictions or special compiler flags.
- **`useLocalSearchParams` vs `useParams`:** NextJS uses `useParams` from `next/navigation` to read route params. Expo Router uses `useLocalSearchParams` to read route parameters on mobile devices.

## Loading State

When loading data in a mobile app, it is important to give the user visual feedback so they know the app hasn't crashed.

While NextJS has a special `loading.js` file convention for server-side loading boundaries, React Native apps typically handle loading state using standard React `useState` variables and Native loading indicators like the **`<ActivityIndicator>`** component from `react-native`.

Here is an example of how you can implement a loading screen in React Native:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { ActivityIndicator, View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function LoadingExample() {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  if (isLoading) {
    return (
      <View className="flex-1 bg-black justify-center items-center">
        <ActivityIndicator size="large" color="#ef4444" />
        <Text className="text-white mt-4">Loading content...</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }

  return (
    <View className="flex-1 bg-black justify-center items-center">
      <Text className="text-white">Content loaded!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

*That is all for this section of the tutorial!*

In Part 2, we will dive into data fetching, calling actual APIs, and populating our video cards with real YouTube videos!

If you made it this far, thank you and I hope this tutorial has helped you get a decent start with React Native and Expo!
